# Lab3

This project is about mashing up a styled vector tileset, which is created from the 2017 Traffic incidents dataset, hosted on Mapbox with my mapping application developed in the previous lab. Users will be able to load and and visualize a different map laer from my Mapbox account. Map layer was designed and published by using Mapbox. User will also be able to toggle on and off the new layer and base layer.
